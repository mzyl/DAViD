### DAViD - Digitally Assisted Video Diverter
DAViD is here to help me battle a personal Goliath: the YouTube homepage recommendations. 
DAViD's job is simple: to show me if there are new videos available that I actively want to know about. 
In other words, I want to know if the channels I subscribe to have uploaded new videos without the chance of having my attention caught be the recommended's list on the homepage. 
If I subscribe to it and there is a new video to watch, and I have decided that now is a good time to watch someting, I want to know that; nothing more, nothing less. 
Are there easier solutions for this? Probably, but where's the fun in that?

### Goals:
- [] Find subscription list via username only.
- [] Identify new videos on each channel.
  - Will have to work out what "new" means. How can it be determined that the video has been watched already?
- [] Return a list of those videos with titles only. Thumbnails are traps.
- [] Maybe return links to each video as well? 
  - You probably don't need a link to each video, but for the ones you actually want to watch..
- [] Section vidoes off by channel.
  - Channel icon is probably okay to include eventually.
- [] Eventually make available as a web service for anyone to use.
  - No logon, no data saved. Just a list of videos you might want to watch. 

### Ideas:
- Maybe instead of using the username and accessing all subscriptions, a custom group can be made. Lets face it, we don't really care to watch every new video from every channel we subscribe to; we have favorites. Probably search by username OR channel name.
